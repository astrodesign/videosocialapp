# videosocialapp
an app which combines the media-swipe aspect of TikTok with the token system of TouchTunes (so you can pay contributors for content you enjoy)


# notes
this is app a sample app I started over the weekend. The idea just popped into my head and I started getting to work. 
this app is missing quite a bit, but I figured I would work on the front end design before I started working on stuff like adding Redux, a graphQL client, and AWS Amplify backend. 

the aplication, when finished, will let you swipe through videos (like TikTok), but I have planned out a token system with Stripe and Stripe Connect which will allow you to purchas tokens and send them to your favorite contributors. This allows you to leave 'tips' for good content and also allows quality creators to earn income directly instead of from ad revenue.
